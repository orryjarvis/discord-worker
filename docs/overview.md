# Discord Worker Bot Overview

This repository contains a simple Discord bot designed to run on Cloudflare Workers. The bot responds to Discord interactions and commands, leveraging serverless infrastructure for lightweight, scalable operation.

## Main Components
- **src/**: Core source code for the bot, including API handlers, command definitions, and integrations.
- **scripts/**: Deployment and utility scripts.
- **test/**: Basic tests for bot functionality.
- **wrangler.toml**: Configuration for Cloudflare Wrangler (deployment tool).
- **package.json**: Project dependencies and scripts.

## How It Works
- The bot listens for Discord events via HTTP endpoints exposed on Cloudflare Workers.
- Commands and interactions are defined in `src/commands.ts` and related files.
- Deployment is managed using Wrangler, which uploads the worker code to Cloudflare.

## Intended Audience
This documentation is designed for both human developers and AI agents seeking to understand, maintain, or update the project.
