TODO:
- streamline prompt for contributing a new feature/command in its entirety
- make commands.ts more dynamic.. it's just another thing to update at the moment
- make local dev "better"?
    - postman collections?
    - a test frontend?
    - debugging
- new commands
    - pokemon stuff
    - more dota stuff
    - "meta" command to create new commands with an agent.. create a PR with new feature?
    - github issue feature request command
    - insult command
    - emojify
- generative ai hooks
- decouple discord request stuff from commands. Discord types shouldn't make it all the way to the commands.
- dev container and code spaces 
- Set up policies in GitHub to pave way for contributions
- cloudflare api key / role / organization best practices
- Pipeline for building services from API specs (like OpenDota spec)
- script to clear kv cache?
- figure out state of global commands and how to refresh
- worker logging / stack trace observability
- Feature flagging
- revamp documentation
- discord interaction "follow-up"?? does this allow for slower replies to not fail?
- http client/fetch injection?
- Editor config
- rethink  default GET path
- split out “integrations” from common services
- open dota integration reliability
- Bluesky integration
- rename "objectstorage" concept to "cache". KV is more of a cache while R2 is the object storage offering.
