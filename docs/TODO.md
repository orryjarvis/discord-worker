TODO:
- e2e tests in ci
- smoke tests on test deployment; deploy to prod if passing
- break out KV into its own service; separate the two uses of KV
- streamline prompt for contributing a new feature/command in its entirety
- make commands.ts more dynamic.. it's just another thing to update at the moment
- make local dev "better"?
    - postman collections?
    - a test frontend?
    - debugging
- new commands
    - pokemon stuff
    - more dota stuff
    - "meta" command to create new commands with an agent.. create a PR with new feature?
- decouple discord request stuff from commands. Discord types shouldn't make it all the way to the commands.
- dev container and code spaces 
- Set up policies in GitHub to pave way for contributions
- cloudflare api key / role / organization best practices
- Pipeline for building services from API specs (like OpenDota spec)
- clear dota service cache on deployment?
- test bot in same server as prod bot? support multiple servers per bot?
    - figure out state of global commands
- worker logging / stack trace observability
- Feature flagging
- revamp documentation
- discord interaction "follow-up"?? does this allow for slower replies to not fail?
